# Charge
Charge simulates electric charges repelling each other in a welldesigned manner. In the app one can switch worlds containing different scenarios where the charges interact to create patterns and phenomenons. The user can also drag all object around to mess with the scenario.

### Ingredients
The visualisation and base physics is created with Matter.js while Require.js used for ... well requireing and modulizing the project. Other than that it is wrapped in Ionic for publishing to IOS.

### Images
##### Scenario *The Molecule*
In this simulation the walls and charges all repell each other, which results in the charges evenly distributing them selves after being spawned in a circle.

##### Scenario *The Whisk*
In this simulation the walls and charges all repell each other but there is one charged pad on the top wall. This pad repells the charges downward which results in a the charges circulating in two directions. Just like a cream whisk.

##### Scenario *The Carousel*
In this simulation the walls and charges all repell each other but there four charged pads on each wall.. These pads all repell the charges to the next pad in line. Which in this case results in a charges running around in a circle.
